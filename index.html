  <p>Self-motivated and outgoing data analyst with a computer science background and skills in Excel, VBA, Python, and SQL from University of Richmondâ€™s data analytics boot camp. Prior work in the data storage and cyber security industries for thirteen years as a customer advocate and partner liaison. Excels with technical translation and communication, as well as producing deliverables on or before a deadline. Strengths including analytical problem solving, collaboration with team members even across long distances, and strong presentation delivery, makes me a valuable addition to any team.</p>
  <p>Recently completed a project in a team of four to compare cost of housing increases in neighborhoods throughout Richmond to increases/decreases in crime rate.</p>
